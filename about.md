>Personal Interests

I love outdoor sports, though I play specific sports. Cricket is my favourite game, as I love to play as well as follow it.

My nickname is hitman23, which is based on Cricket and my birthdate. hitman is a nick for the cricket player, [Rohit Sharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohit_Sharma), for his aggressive ability to hit the cricket ball. I am a huge fan of him, and love to watch him play cricket, especially his silken drives and lovely pulls. So I never miss out on matches where he plays.

> Time spending hobbies

I usually spend time watching movies, if not playing any sport. Listening to music is an all time favourite. I usually watch thriller movies, and love the movies directed by Christopher Nolan.
